Tools for manipulating PBM fonts and generating C headers for small console fonts

WARNING: DO NOT USE
Currently, this does not even work. Even if it did, the goal turned out not to be nearly as simple as I envisioned,
so I have cut the scope of this project back all the way down to only supporting fonts with a 4-pixel width,
as that is what I need for the other project I'm actually intending to work on, that this has become a distraction
from and barrier to. Sorry; if it's worth it to you even as a starting point, pull requests are welcome,
and very much invited, as I do believe this has utility, and I couldn't find a similar project from anyone else.
